Salt Language Server Protocol Server

## History & Current State

This is a Hackweek project of [Cédric Bosdonnat](https://github.com/cbosdo) and
[Dan Čermák](https://github.com/dcermak) that reached an early prototype
state. However, we never really managed to handle Jinja2 templating in `sls`
files (see [`salt-lsp#31`](https://github.com/dcermak/salt-lsp/pull/31)) which
is a requirement for this project to be even remotely useful.

Unfortunately neither of the two original authors currently have the time to
keep this project alive. If you wish to help out, please open an issue or send a
pull request fixing the existing bugs/shortcomings.

As of now, here be 🐉.


## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- VSCode (required for live testing the server from an editor)


## Server Setup

Install the dependencies:

```ShellSession
$ poetry install
```

Create the completion classes once:

```ShellSession
$ poetry run dump_state_name_completions
```

Start the server:

```ShellSession
$ poetry run salt_lsp_server --tcp
```

Install the server:
```ShellSession
$ poetry build
$ pip install --user --force-reinstall dist/salt_lsp-0.0.1*whl
```

# Clients

## VSCode

1. Run `yarn install`
2. Start VSCode and open this directory as the server
3. Open the Debug menu (Ctrl + Shift + D)
4. Select "Launch Client" drop down
5. Press F5


## Emacs

You should install [salt-mode](https://github.com/glynnforrest/salt-mode) so
that `sls` files are registered to the salt major mode. The language server must
be installed on your system so that the clients can launch it.

### Using lsp-mode

1. Install & configure [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/)
2. Load the file `clients/emacs/salt-lsp.el`
3. Open a sls file and launch `lsp` via `M-x lsp`


### Using eglot

1. Install & configure [eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot)
2. Evaluate the following snippet:
```elisp
(add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(salt-mode . ("python3" "-m" "salt_lsp")))
```
3. Launch eglot via `M-x eglot`
